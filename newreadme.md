## PAttn
1.type "bash ./script/ETTh.sh" since folder name is script instead of scripts

2.Issue:
AttributeError: `np.Inf` was removed in the NumPy 2.0 release. Use `np.inf` instead.  
This is a known breaking change introduced in NumPy 2.0.  

✅ Fix: Modify tools.py  
Edit the file:

LLMsForTimeSeries/PAttn/utils/tools.py
Find line 50 (or nearby):

self.val_loss_min = np.Inf
Replace it with:

self.val_loss_min = np.inf
🔁 Repeat this for any other occurrences of np.Inf.

✅ Why This Works:
In NumPy < 2.0, both np.Inf and np.inf were allowed.

In NumPy 2.0, np.Inf was removed for consistency — use lowercase np.inf.

3.FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: './datasets/ETT-small/ETTh1.csv'
Because the script you're running likely uses:

--root_path ./datasets/ETT-small/
instead of:

--root_path ../datasets/ETT-small/
That makes the script look for:

bash

./datasets/ETT-small/ETTh1.csv
which does not exist inside PAttn/.

✅ Fix It Now
✏️ Edit script/ETTh.sh
Find this line (or similar):

--root_path ./datasets/ETT-small/
Change it to:

--root_path ../datasets/ETT-small/
Do this for both ETTh1 and ETTh2 blocks inside ETTh.sh.

✅ Then re-run:

bash ./script/ETTh.sh
That should finally solve the FileNotFoundError. Let me know if you want me to regenerate the fixed version of ETTh.sh for you.
